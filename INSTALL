Install as modules
==================

Just run

  make

and

  make install   # (as root)

to build and install the modules for the currently running kernel.
The modules are called usb-vhci-hcd and usb-vhci-iocifc. Run

  modprobe usb-vhci-hcd &&
  modprobe usb-vhci-iocifc

to load the modules.


Patch into kernel
=================

Run

  make KVERSION=<VERSION> KSRC=<PATH_TO_KERNEL_SOURCE> patchkernel

(replace <PATH_TO_KERNEL_SOURCE> with the actual path) to patch the vhci-hcd
sources into the kernel source. If you want to do this for a kernel with a
different version than the currently running one, then you need to create
the config header first by running

  make config

and answering the few questions about the target kernel.
